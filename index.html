        <p>My name is Jameer Harris and I am 15 years old; my favorite subject in school is multicultural 
        literature. Currently I am not participating in any school activities because 
        I wanted to focus on my freshman year academics. However, next year I plan to 
        participate in basketball and robotics. At this time I do not have a part-time job.
        I have volunteered to obtain school credit but I am interested in volunteering 
        whenever the opportunity present itself. Some of the places I have volunteered are 
        Cornerstone Community Outreach where we feed the homeless and Fuller Center for
        Housing (Culinary Hero Program) where I help to prepare meals for the U.S. veterans.
        I have received several rewards in track, which where silver and gold metals. My
        hobbies are to play basketball, football, gaming, drawing, and web design. My career
        goals are to become an entrepreneur within the technology and culinary industry.</p>
